# Dev-CI check runner for the TAPRX-888 KiCad project (Phase 1).
#
# Runs ERC, DRC, and a BOM completeness check with kicad-cli, plus a 3D-model
# resolution check, and produces the schematic PDF, gerbers/drill, the board
# STEP and a top 3D render as artifacts. The KiBot turnkey/release outputs
# (interactive BOM, CPL, composited PDFs) are the release pipeline.
#
# Gating is governed by ENFORCE:
#   ENFORCE=false (default) -> checks run and report, but never fail the job
#                              (bring-up mode: the design has known ERC/DRC
#                               violations tracked as issues; this captures the
#                               baseline as artifacts without blocking).
#   ENFORCE=true            -> ERC / DRC / BOM violations fail the job.
# Flip to true once the tracked ERC/DRC issues are cleared, and add these as
# required status checks in the dev/main rulesets at the same time.
